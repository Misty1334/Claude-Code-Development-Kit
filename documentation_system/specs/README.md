# Specifications

This directory contains detailed technical specifications for features, integrations, and system components. Specifications serve as blueprints for implementation and reference documentation for ongoing development.

## Purpose

Specifications documentation serves to:
- **Define requirements** clearly before implementation
- **Guide development** with detailed technical plans
- **Ensure consistency** across team members and time
- **Track progress** against defined success criteria
- **Enable estimation** of development effort and timelines

## Specification Categories

### Feature Specifications
- New functionality requirements
- User interface specifications
- Business logic requirements
- Data model definitions
- API endpoint specifications

### Integration Specifications
- External service integrations
- Database integration patterns
- Third-party API integrations
- Inter-service communication
- Authentication and authorization

### System Specifications
- Architecture decisions
- Performance requirements
- Security specifications
- Deployment configurations
- Monitoring and observability

## Template Usage

The directory includes example specifications that serve as templates:

### Feature Specification Template
Use `example-feature-specification.md` for:
- New feature development
- System component specifications
- User-facing functionality
- Database schema changes

### API Integration Template
Use `example-api-integration-spec.md` for:
- External service integrations
- Third-party API connections
- Inter-service communication
- Authentication flows

## Specification Structure

Each specification should include:

1. **Overview**: Purpose, objectives, and scope
2. **Architecture**: System design and data flow
3. **Technical Specifications**: Detailed implementation requirements
4. **Implementation Plan**: Phased development approach
5. **API Documentation**: Endpoints, requests, and responses
6. **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and acceptance testing
7. **Performance Considerations**: Scalability and optimization
8. **Security Considerations**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
9. **Deployment**: Configuration, environment setup, monitoring
10. **Success Criteria**: Definition of done and acceptance criteria

## File Naming Convention

- `feature-[component]-[functionality].md`
- `integration-[service]-[type].md`
- `system-[area]-[specification].md`
- `api-[service]-[version].md`
- `architecture-[component]-[decision].md`

Examples:
- `feature-auth-user-management.md`
- `integration-payment-stripe-api.md`
- `system-database-performance-optimization.md`
- `api-notification-service-v2.md`

## Development Workflow Integration

Specifications integrate with development workflow:

1. **Planning Phase**:
   - Create specification document
   - Review and approve with stakeholders
   - Break down into development tasks

2. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Reference specification during development
   - Update specification with decisions and changes
   - Track progress against success criteria

3. **Testing Phase**:
   - Use specification for test case creation
   - Validate implementation against requirements
   - Document any deviations or changes

4. **Deployment Phase**:
   - Follow deployment procedures in specification
   - Monitor success criteria and performance metrics
   - Update documentation with operational details

## AI Assistant Benefits

Well-written specifications enable AI assistants to:
- **Understand requirements** when implementing features
- **Follow established patterns** for consistency
- **Generate appropriate tests** based on specifications
- **Suggest optimizations** aligned with performance requirements
- **Maintain code quality** according to defined standards

## Quality Guidelines

Effective specifications should be:
- **Clear and Unambiguous**: Avoid vague language
- **Technically Detailed**: Include code examples and diagrams
- **Actionable**: Provide specific implementation guidance
- **Testable**: Define measurable success criteria
- **Maintainable**: Keep updated as requirements evolve

## Review Process

Specifications should undergo review:
- **Technical Review**: Architecture and implementation approach
- **Security Review**: Security requirements and considerations
- **Performance Review**: Scalability and performance requirements
- **Business Review**: Alignment with business objectives

## Version Control

- Track changes to specifications over time
- Document reasons for requirement changes
- Maintain compatibility with existing implementations
- Plan migration paths for breaking changes

## Example Specifications

The included examples demonstrate:
- **Comprehensive planning** for complex features
- **Detailed technical requirements** with code examples
- **Security and performance considerations**
- **Testing strategies** for reliable implementation
- **Deployment and operational procedures**

Use these examples as starting points and adapt them to your specific project requirements, technology stack, and development processes.
