# Open Issues

This directory contains documentation for ongoing technical issues, bugs, and improvements that require attention or investigation.

## Purpose

Open issues documentation serves to:
- **Track problems** that need resolution
- **Document root causes** and analysis
- **Plan solutions** and implementation approaches
- **Maintain context** for future development
- **Enable collaboration** on complex technical challenges

## Issue Categories

### Bug Reports
- Production issues affecting users
- System reliability problems
- Performance degradation
- Integration failures

### Technical Debt
- Code quality improvements needed
- Architecture refactoring requirements
- Deprecated dependency updates
- Security vulnerability patches

### Feature Gaps
- Missing functionality identified
- User experience improvements
- API enhancements needed
- Integration requirements

## Template Usage

Use the provided template (`example-api-performance-issue.md`) as a starting point for documenting new issues:

1. **Copy the template** to create a new issue file
2. **Use descriptive naming**: `[category]-[brief-description].md`
3. **Fill in all relevant sections** with specific details
4. **Update status** as work progresses
5. **Link related files** and references

## File Naming Convention

- `bug-[component]-[brief-description].md`
- `performance-[area]-[issue-type].md`
- `security-[vulnerability-type].md`
- `integration-[system]-[problem].md`
- `refactor-[component]-[improvement].md`

## Integration with Development Workflow

Open issues should integrate with your development process:
- **Reference in commits**: Link commits to issue files
- **Update during development**: Keep status and progress current
- **Close when resolved**: Mark status as fixed/closed
- **Archive completed issues**: Move to separate archive directory

## AI Assistant Benefits

Well-documented open issues enable AI assistants to:
- **Understand context** when working on related code
- **Suggest solutions** based on documented analysis
- **Avoid introducing** similar issues
- **Maintain continuity** across development sessions
- **Prioritize work** based on documented impact

## Example Issues

The template provides examples for:
- API performance problems
- Database optimization needs
- Integration challenges
- Security vulnerabilities
- Code quality improvements

Adapt the template structure to match your project's specific technical challenges and workflow requirements.
