# AI Development Framework

A sophisticated AI-assisted development methodology leveraging Claude Code with MCP server integrations for complex software engineering tasks.

## Overview

This framework demonstrates advanced patterns for AI-assisted development including:

- **Multi-agent orchestration** for complex code analysis and implementation
- **Adaptive context management** with structured documentation systems
- **MCP server integration** for specialized AI capabilities
- **Sophisticated command templates** for common development workflows

## Key Components

### Documentation System
- **AI Context Architecture**: Structured documentation optimized for AI consumption
- **Auto-loading Context**: Intelligent project context management
- **Adaptive Documentation**: Documentation that scales with project complexity

### Command Templates
- **Full Context Analysis**: Multi-agent system for comprehensive code understanding
- **Strategic Code Review**: High-impact code review focusing on production risks
- **Architecture Planning**: Systematic approach to complex implementation planning

### MCP Server Integration
- **Gemini Coding Assistant**: Advanced coding consultation with session management
- **Context7 Documentation**: Up-to-date library documentation access
- **Custom Integration Patterns**: Proven patterns for MCP server orchestration

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI tool
- [Gemini MCP Server](https://github.com/peterkrueck/gemini-mcp) for AI consultation
- [Context7 MCP Server](https://github.com/upstash/context7) for up-to-date documentation access
- Python 3.8+ and Node.js 18+ for MCP server setup

## Quick Start

1. **Install MCP Servers**:
   ```bash
   # Install Gemini MCP Server
   git clone https://github.com/peterkrueck/gemini-mcp.git
   cd gemini-mcp
   # Follow installation instructions in the repository
   
   # Install Context7 MCP Server
   git clone https://github.com/upstash/context7.git
   cd context7
   # Follow installation instructions in the repository
   ```

2. **Copy Framework Components**:
   ```bash
   # Copy documentation system to your project
   cp -r documentation_system/* your-project/docs/
   
   # Copy command templates to your project
   cp -r commands/* your-project/.claude/commands/
   ```

3. **Configure Your Project**:
   - Adapt the `CLAUDE-template.md` to your project specifics
   - Update documentation structure in `docs/ai-context/`
   - Customize command templates for your development workflow

## Architecture

The framework operates on three core principles:

1. **Context-First Development**: AI systems work best with comprehensive, structured context
2. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Complex tasks benefit from specialized AI agents working in parallel
3. **Iterative Sophistication**: Start simple, add complexity as needs evolve

## Usage Patterns

### Full Context Analysis
For comprehensive understanding of complex codebases:
```bash
claude exec full-context "analyze the authentication system"
```

### Strategic Code Review
For production-focused code review:
```bash
claude exec code-review "review the payment processing module"
```

### Architecture Planning
For systematic implementation planning:
```bash
claude exec architecture "plan real-time collaboration feature"
```

## Integration with MCP Servers

The framework is designed to work seamlessly with MCP servers:

- **Gemini Consultation**: For complex coding problems requiring deep analysis
- **Context7 Documentation**: For up-to-date library and framework documentation
- **Custom MCP Servers**: Extensible patterns for domain-specific AI tools
