# Deployment & Infrastructure Patterns - Template

*This file documents deployment, monitoring, and infrastructure patterns for your application.*

## Purpose

This template helps document:
- **Deployment strategies** and containerization patterns
- **Infrastructure setup** for development and production
- **Monitoring and observability** patterns
- **CI/CD pipelines** and automation workflows
- **Scaling considerations** and performance optimization

## Template Sections

### Deployment Patterns

Document your deployment approach:

```yaml
# Example: Docker containerization
# Dockerfile example for your application
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

```yaml
# Example: Docker Compose for local development
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
```

### Environment Configuration

Document environment setup and configuration management:

```bash
# Example: Environment variables structure
# Development
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/myapp_dev
API_KEY=development_key
LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://prod-server:5432/myapp_prod
API_KEY=production_key
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### Monitoring & Observability

Document your monitoring strategy:

```yaml
# Example: Application monitoring
monitoring:
  metrics:
    - response_time
    - error_rate
    - throughput
    - resource_usage
  
  logging:
    level: info
    format: json
    destinations:
      - console
      - file
      - remote_service
  
  health_checks:
    - endpoint: /health
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

Document your automation workflows:

```yaml
# Example: GitHub Actions workflow
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Run linting
        run: npm run lint
  
  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: echo "Deploy to production"
```

### Infrastructure as Code

Document infrastructure provisioning:

```yaml
# Example: Infrastructure setup
infrastructure:
  cloud_provider: [AWS/GCP/Azure/etc]
  
  services:
    - name: web_server
      type: container_service
      instances: 2
      resources:
        cpu: 1
        memory: 2GB
    
    - name: database
      type: managed_database
      engine: postgresql
      version: "14"
      storage: 100GB
    
    - name: cache
      type: redis
      memory: 1GB
```

### Development Environment Setup

Document local development setup:

```bash
# Example: Development setup script
#!/bin/bash

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup database
docker-compose up -d postgres

# Run migrations
npm run migrate

# Seed development data
npm run seed

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Production Considerations

Document production deployment requirements:

- **Security**: SSL certificates, firewall rules, access controls
- **Performance**: Load balancing, caching strategies, CDN configuration
- **Reliability**: Backup strategies, disaster recovery, high availability
- **Compliance**: Data protection, audit logging, regulatory requirements

### Scaling Strategies

Document how to scale your application:

```yaml
# Example: Scaling configuration
scaling:
  horizontal:
    min_instances: 2
    max_instances: 10
    target_cpu: 70%
    target_memory: 80%
  
  vertical:
    cpu_limits: 2
    memory_limits: 4GB
  
  database:
    read_replicas: 2
    connection_pooling: enabled
    query_optimization: enabled
```

### Deployment Checklist

Document pre-deployment verification:

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Security scan completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Database migrations tested
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts configured
- [ ] Backup procedures verified
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

## Integration with AI Development

This documentation enables AI assistants to:
- **Understand deployment context** when making infrastructure changes
- **Follow established patterns** for new services
- **Suggest optimizations** based on documented strategies
- **Maintain consistency** across deployment environments
- **Troubleshoot issues** using documented patterns

## Customization Guidelines

Adapt this template by:

1. **Replace examples** with your actual infrastructure patterns
2. **Add sections** for your specific deployment requirements
3. **Document performance benchmarks** and scaling thresholds
4. **Include troubleshooting guides** for common deployment issues
5. **Update monitoring strategies** based on your observability needs

## Maintenance

Keep this documentation current by:
- **Updating** when infrastructure changes are made
- **Adding** new deployment patterns as they're established
- **Reviewing** regularly during infrastructure planning
- **Validating** that documented procedures still work

*This template provides a foundation for documenting deployment and infrastructure patterns. Customize it based on your specific technology stack, deployment requirements, and operational procedures.*
